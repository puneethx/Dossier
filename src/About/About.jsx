          Hello! I'm Puneeth Reddy, a dedicated and motivated student currently in my 6th Semester (3rd Year) at Vellore Institute of Technology,
          pursuing b.tech in Computer Science Engineering. <br/><br/>
          With a passion for technology and deep interest in web development, I have started learning to become a proficient full-stack web developer.
          My main objective is to create exceptional websites that not only function flawlessly but also provide a delightful user experience through intuitive and aesthetically pleasing designs.
          I've been marked a strong commitment to learning new technologies, frame works and methodologies. 
          <br/>I genuinely think that flexibility is the key to success in web development, and I am constantly keen to investigate and implement cutting-edge solutions into my projects.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          As I progress in my academic journey, I am actively seeking opportunities to apply my skills and knowledge in real-world settings.
          I've created several websites that reflect my dedication to the craft of web development, and I encourage you to explore these projects in more detail in Projects section.
